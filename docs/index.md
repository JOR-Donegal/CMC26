# Introduction

!!! abstract "CPU, Memory, Cache and Disks"

These practical exercises are intended to get you to do initial reconnaissance of 
- Processor
- Cache
- Main Memory.
- Disks

I also get you to look at predictive failure analysis for disk...you might want to read above the efficay of this. It sounds great, does it work?

I cover the CPU hardware technology in another module, if you have not yet covered this, discuss with your lecturer.
