# Introduction

!!! abstract "Practical CPU, Memory, Cache"

These practical exercises are intended to get you to do initial reconnaissance of Processor, Cache and Main Memory.

I also get you to look at predictive failure analysis for disk...you might want to read above the efficay of this. It sounds great, does it work?

I cover the CPU hardware technology in another module, if you have not yet covered this, discuss with your lecturer.
