# BIOS/UEFI settings
If you are not familiar with BIOS and UEFI, do a little background reading now. 

In this exercise , we will look at some basic tools for reconnaissance of main memory.

1. You may carry out this step on your own computer ONLY.
- Boot your personal computer and enter BIOS/UEFI, do not change any settings. 
- Locate all the information you can relating to memory and cache, explain and document it.

2. It is always good to be able to identify memory components and configuration remotely, or without powering down the machine and dismantling. 
- In the search box of the OS, type __System__ and open the _System Information_ dialog.
- Locate all the information you can relating to memory and cache, explain and document it.

3. You can do a more detailed analysis using tools. A very common tool used is CPU-Z.
- Locate and download a copy of CPU-Z.
- You may NOT install this on a lab PC. Alternatively, it is a small application you may install on your home computer or preferably, a VM.
- Map out the CPU, memory and cache in your computer, identifying all components in detail.
